Plugin generic
==============

Purpose
=======

The generic plugin is used to handle xPL messages sent by xPL clients that are not part of Domogik. They can be *arduino* DIY devices, ...
The generic plugin contains only the description of the xPL messages to catch and so there is nothing to start/stop and nothing to configure.

You just have to install the plugin, check it is present in the clients list and create some devices. 

Please notice that you must see your external xPL clients in the clients list as **xPL clients**. If you don't see them, it means that the xPL hub doesn't see them and so the plugin won't be able to catch the xPL messages.

To be detected by the xPL hub (and Domogik), a xPL client must implement the heartbeat xPL messages. More informations here : http://xplproject.org.uk/wiki/index.php/XPL_Specification_Document#Heartbeat_Messages
Notice that some DIY projects don't implement the heartbeat messages and so Domogik won't see them!

If you want to **create your own arduino xPL client**, you can use this library : https://github.com/olebrun/xPL.Arduino

You can check if a xPL message is received on Domogik side by launching the **dmg_dump** tool.

Dependencies
============

There is no dependency.

Plugin configuration
